Throughout the entire build testing was on going, each new feature was rigorously tested to make sure it was working when used.

To aid in development google dev tools, as well as lighthouse and the w3 validators were utilized to ensure everything worked to standard

I also went through each page and tested the features vs my established user stories to ensure it was all working correctly

## AUTOMATED TESTING

### W3C Validator

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the html and css to check for errors and consistency

### Lighthouse

I also used the lighthouse chrome plugin to run checks for each page on both desktop and mobile view
